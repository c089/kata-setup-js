kata-setup-js
=============

My setup for doing TDD katas in JavaScript.

There are also some solutions available, each on it's own branch. Some of those
are mine, some are katas I did with pair partners, some have been done by
groups of more people during randori-style dojo sessions.

Instructions:

* install dependencies: `npm install`
* run tests on each file change: `npm run-script watch`
* print the specification: `npm test`
